# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **If you just created something, wait at least 30 days before submitting.** This is to give it some time to mature and ensure it's not just a publish-and-forget type of project.
- If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list, argue how it's better.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the list.
- Link to the GitHub repo, not npmjs.com or its website.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Don't mention `Truffle Plugin` in the description as it's implied.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.

Thank you for your suggestion!
